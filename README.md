This program performas Caesar Cipher to encrypt a file.

The plain text file is given as input to the program. An absolute or relative path to the file can be given. Optionally, the location of the encrypted file can also be given. If not given, the program will generate a file in the same directory as the plain text file and put the encrypted contents there.

This program has a simple command line interface and can work with a single text-based (ASCII) file at a time.
